Classpad
========

Classpad is the next generation of taking notes in classes.

Imagine to be a student, with Classpad you don't even need to copy the content of the classboard, the notes of the teacher will appear directly in front of you: 

- Much time to understand the lesson.
- No more missing notes.
- No matter if you're taking 500 students course: wherever you are in the class, it's like you're directly in front of the blackboard.

And now imagine to be a teacher, Classpad will:

- Allow you to have all your classes in the cloud anytime availables.
- Let you prepare lessons before, declaring it as 'private' and changing it to 'public' only whan you need, and vice-versa.

To let Classpad be usable from the most of users, we designed Classpad to be platform independent engeenering it as a webapp so you only need a web-browser (de-facto installed by default in every device you may have).
You may say: "This is great but how mouch does it costs? and how i have to do to use this?".
Classpad is open-source, and based on open-source tools, so it's completely free! In particular it's based on nodejs so if you're a school or a university you just need a machine that works as a nodejs server, you have just to clone this repo, start the server and allow both your students and teachers to connect to that server.
